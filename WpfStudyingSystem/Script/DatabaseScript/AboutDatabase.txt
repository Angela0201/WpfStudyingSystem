Idk how to correctly implement database

Right now, as i understanded, the database is generated locally and connects itself to "StudySystemDB.mdf", 
then its extract all data from it, and when you saving data during runtime, it saves the data in your local database (not the mdf file).
That way, when you restart an application, all data, that was saved in runtime, is deleted, but the base data remain (that is in the mdf file).
