Idk how to correctly implement database

AS I UNDERSTANDED, it works that way right now:

1.It takes the data from "StudySystemDB.mdf" in database folder and creates new one in bin foldeer
2.All the runtime updates are saved in bin database, not the one in file
3.if you update the files in mdf database in Database, and then update the databases in sql server explorer, then the bin database will bee recreated by the first step

P.S. May be its good to attach event, so all he tables will assign themselves correctly, but i need to read how.
